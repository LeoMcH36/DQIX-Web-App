# DQIX-Web-App
DQIX Web App to practice some skills like node.js json html DOM,css Flex, js ,mysql etc

The About page Basically explains everything, and I want you to see it lol it's a pretty cool page (soon to be improved)
The Home page images wont work obviously because their paths were stored in a MySQL database.
I'm also aware you should de-couple the data, but it's ok not to just for this project.
